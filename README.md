## What is Deli?

Deli is a performance modeling tool, allowing you to understand and experiment
with new designs at several orders of magnitude faster than wall-clock time.
Deli is used to determine time for jobs or requests to be finished. Deli borrows concepts and
terminology from [queueing
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory), and is implemented as a
Haskell DSL, exposing a [Go (language)](https://golang.org/) -like concurrency
and message-passing API.

Deli's documentation is divided into the following three sections, depending on
